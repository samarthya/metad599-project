# Final Project: Advanced Data Analysis with SQL, SQL Python Integration, and Business Insights

## Overview

In this project, you'll assume the role of a data analyst at Northwind Traders, a fictional international gourmet food distributor. Your task is to extract meaningful insights from the company's database to inform strategic business decisions. The final project has three phases:

- Phase 1: Solve everything in SQL. If you need something else to solve the problem thoroughly, you can complete it in Phase 2 and only provide an actionable plan. You need to submit a Phase Report as a team for phase 1.
- Phase 2: Solve every question in SQL Python Integration (Executing SQL queries directly in Python). You need to submit a Phase Report as a team for Phase 2. Phase 2 is an intermediate upgrade of Phase 1.
- Phase 3: Final report and final presentation. You need to submit a Final Report as a team and present as a team for the final presentation. Slides are expected for the final presentation. Each team shall have 10 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for potential Q&A.

### Phase 1 (10 Points)

- Part 1: Employee Sales Performance Analysis (2 Points)

**Objective:** Identify top-performing employees based on their total sales.​

#### Tasks

Calculate the total sales amount for each employee.​
Rank employees based on their total sales performance. Choose a ranking window function carefully.

- Part 2: Monthly Sales Trend Analysis (2 Points)

**Objective:** Analyze monthly sales trends to identify peak sales periods.

#### Tasks

Aggregate total sales for each month.
Calculate the month-over-month sales growth.

- Part 3: Product Sales Ranking by Category (3 Points)

**Objective:** Determine the top-selling products within each category.

#### Tasks

Calculate total sales for each product.
Rank products within their categories. Choose a ranking window function carefully.

- Part 4: Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis (3 Points)

**Objective:** Identify customers with the highest average order value.

#### Tasks

Calculate the average order value for each customer.
Rank customers based on their average order value. Show the customers with Ranks of 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 17. Choose a ranking function carefully.

### Phase 2 (10 Points)

- Part 1: Employee Sales Performance Analysis (2 Points)

**Objective:** Identify top-performing employees based on their total sales.

#### Tasks

Calculate the total sales amount for each employee. Rank employees based on their total sales performance. Choose a ranking window function carefully. Run everything in SQL Python integration. (Executing SQL queries directly in Python)
Build a bar chart to show the top 5 performing employees with their sales amount.

- Part 2: Monthly Sales Trend Analysis (2 Points)

**Objective:** Analyze monthly sales trends to identify peak sales periods.

#### Tasks
Aggregate total sales for each month. Calculate the month-over-month sales growth. Run everything in SQL Python integration. (Executing SQL queries directly in Python)
Build a Visualization of the Sales Trends in Python.

- Part 3: Product Sales Ranking by Category (3 Points)

**Objective:** Determine the top-selling products within each category.

#### Tasks

Calculate total sales for each product. Rank products within their categories. Choose a ranking window function carefully. Run everything in SQL Python integration. (Executing SQL queries directly in Python)

- Part 4: Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis (3 Points)

**Objective:** Identify customers with the highest average order value.

#### Tasks

Calculate the average order value for each customer. Rank customers based on their average order value. Show the customers with Ranks of 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 17. Choose a ranking function carefully. Run everything in SQL Python integration. (Executing SQL queries directly in Python)


#### Phase 3 (Final) (6 Points):

Summarize everything in a final report as a team. You can regard the whole project as 4 parts, each of which has 3 steps: SQL, SQL Python Integration and some extra work, and putting everything together.
Prepare for a 10-minute team final presentation of your findings/results/business insights. Per social convention, slides are expected.
